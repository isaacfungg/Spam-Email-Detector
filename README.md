# Model Evaluation README

This README provides an overview of the performance of machine learning models on two different datasets: the original training dataset and a new, previously unseen dataset. The models considered for evaluation are Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier.

## Model Performance on Original Training Dataset

### Original Training Dataset

#### Support Vector Classifier (SVC) - 0.9983
SVC_accuracy_on_original_training_data = 0.9983

#### Logistic Regression - 0.9983
LogisticRegression_accuracy_on_original_training_data = 0.9983

#### Random Forest Classifier - 0.9948
RandomForestClassifier_accuracy_on_original_training_data = 0.9948

#### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier - 0.9930
KNN_accuracy_on_original_training_data = 0.9930

#### Gradient Boosting Classifier - 0.9843
GradientBoostingClassifier_accuracy_on_original_training_data = 0.9843

#### Decision Tree Classifier - 0.97
DecisionTreeClassifier_accuracy_on_original_training_data = 0.97

## Model Performance on New Data

### New, Unseen Data

#### Support Vector Classifier (SVC) - 0.9449
SVC_accuracy_on_new_data = 0.9449

#### Logistic Regression - 0.9207
LogisticRegression_accuracy_on_new_data = 0.9207

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the models performed exceptionally well on the original training dataset, with accuracy scores above 97% when tested on the same data they were trained on. However, their performance declined when tested on a new, previously unseen dataset, as follows:

- Support Vector Classifier (SVC) achieved an accuracy of 94.49% on the new data.
- Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 92.07% on the new data.

This drop in performance on new data is a common challenge in machine learning and highlights the importance of considering data generalization. It's crucial to understand that models may not perform as well on data they have never seen before. Further investigation is needed to adapt models for better generalization to new datasets.
